# CTA_StationDisplay

A primitive WinUI3 Client for dispalying real-time CTA 'L' Station arrival information as seen on overhead displays.

## Usage

-Input your CTA API key in the marked field (avaialble for free from https://www.transitchicago.com/developers/traintrackerapply/)
  
-Select from the list of Line Colors to display all associated stations.  Selecting a station launches the display for that station (not limited to the selected line color)

## Notes

-Very primitive client, just for fun.

-Still need to add selector for platform/direction (currently displays all arriving trains in both directions)
